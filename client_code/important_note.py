Note on Icons:


This app uses Bootstrap Icons instead of Font Awesome Icons. You can find the entire icon pack for this website at https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

For example, if you want to add the icon 'house' (https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/house/) to a component, set its icon property to fa:house 

To resort back to Font Awesome Icons, remove the line (<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/divyesh06/Geeke/bootstrap-icons.css">) from
Native Library
